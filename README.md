CL-DevIL is a Common Lisp library that includes bindings to the
[DevIL](http://openil.sourceforge.net/) Image library. It includes direct bindings to DevIL's C API,
as well as some utility functions that wrap these.

# Installation

CL-DevIL is [Quicklisp](http://quicklisp.org)-installable, allowing for super-quick, painless
installation of CL-DevIL and all its Lisp dependencies.

Additionally, you will need to make DevIL itself available to CFFI by placing DevIL's compiled
dynamic libraries somewhere visible to it.
